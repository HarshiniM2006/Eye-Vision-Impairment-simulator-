# Eye-Vision-Impairment-simulator-
A MATLAB project that simulates different types of eye vision impairments like cataracts, macular degeneration, glaucoma, and color blindness. It helped me understand how these conditions affect vision by visualizing them with image processing techniques.
What It Does

The project takes a normal image and applies different filters and masks to simulate:
- Cataracts: Blurs the whole image to mimic the effect of cloudy lenses.
- Macular Degeneration: Creates a black spot in the center representing loss of central vision.
- Glaucoma: Simulates tunnel vision by darkening the peripheral areas.
- Deuteranopia (Red-Green Color Blindness): Alters colors to show how red and green hues become hard to distinguish.

How I Built It
- I used MATLAB’s built-in image processing functions like Gaussian blur, masks, and color transformations to create each effect. The project helped me practice working with matrices, image channels, and visualizing results in MATLAB figures.

Why I Made This
- I wanted to get a hands-on understanding of vision impairments in a visual way rather than just reading about them. It was both a fun and educational experience, and I hope this can be useful for others who want to learn or demonstrate how these eye conditions impact vision.

How to Use
- Open the MATLAB script file.
- Run the script — it will load a sample image and show the original and simulated images one by one.
- You can replace the sample image with your own by changing the filename in the script.
- Feel free to tweak the parameters like blur strength or mask size to see different severity levels.

What I Learned
- Working with image matrices and color channels in MATLAB
- How to apply filters and masks for image manipulation.
- Basic understanding of different vision impairments and their visual effects.
- How to turn a concept into a visual simulation project.

Notes
- I used ChatGPT to help me with the coding and explanations, which made the learning process smoother and faster.
- This project is mainly for educational and demonstration purposes and is not a medical tool.

Feel Free to Contribute
- If you have ideas for other vision impairments to simulate or ways to improve this project, I’d love to see your contributions!
